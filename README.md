learn_python
============

Originally a cache of all the exercises I did while going through Zed Shaw's "Learn Python the Hard Way" book.

It now serves as a spot where I put *all* of the Python exercises from the various books I'm reading.

Each book, course, or website tutorial has its own subdirectory. Reference to the source material is provided via URL or bibliography entry.

Code is provided as is, with bugs. I try to clean up old code when I have a lull between books. All code is my own and makes no attempt to be the ideal solution to any exercise--it is merely *my* solution. The freedom to fail is paramount to the development of one's skills. I attempted, when possible, to put the exercise prompt in as a comment header, so that it may be viewed in isolation without requiring the source textbook.
